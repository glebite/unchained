# unchained  
A project using Django to create a default landing page to lower the amount of time I waste in the morning.  

Essentially, I want certain information displayed on a landing page when I 
either turn on my computer or connect from my phone.  The intention is to 
have it run on a raspberry pi.  

What I'm thinking of right now is a page with some sort of customizable 
sections - weather info, timezone, pull up some camera images (thumbs) and
possibly uptime of systems or other random stuff.  

Mainly, it's an exercise in dusting off my Django work that I did before and prepare myself for a different future.
